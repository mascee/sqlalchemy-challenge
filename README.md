Challenge 10 by Olga Petrova

Hawaii climate exploration.

In this assignment the task was to extract data from hawaii.sqlite and explore temperature and precipitation taken at different locations in Hawaii during one year.
 For this task I created 2 programs: climate.ipynb and app.py

 climate.ipynb creates engine to explore .sqlite data base, takes temperature and precipitation from differen data points, creates data frame and graphs results. 
 app.py creates API for temperature, precipitation and average results.

 From these graphs a person can make a desision when to plan a vacation to Hawaii, to see when the weather is better.
